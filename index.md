  Hi! I am a researcher turned data scientist, currently working at Pactera in the fraud detection and risk management team. From a previous life I have a Ph.D in chemistry, where I studied crystal morphologies using molecular dynamics simulations. In particular my projects involved trying to understand the bending and twisting mode during early stage of crystal growths.
