  Hi! I am a researcher turned data scientist, currently working at Pactera in the fraud detection and risk data science team. From a previous life I have a Ph.D in chemistry, where I studied crystal morphologies using molecular dynamics simulations. In particular my projects involved trying to understand the bending and twisting modes during early stage of crystal growths.

## About me

Before joining NYU, I got my B.S in Materials Science from DongHua University. At NYU, I joined [MDI](https://www.nyumdi.com/), advised by [Bart Kahr](https://www.kahrlab.com/).

After Ph.D, I decided to switch my career to data science/machine learning and joined fraud detection and risk data science team at [Pactera](https://en.pactera.com/). I built rule-based as well as machine learning model-based risk systems for various microsoft's commercial products.
